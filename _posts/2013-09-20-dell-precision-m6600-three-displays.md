Work provides a nice  Dell Precision M6600 laptop workstation. It is a nice laptop and the dockingstation provides ports to connect additional displays. Our M6600 comes with the ATI Fire Pro M8900 chipset and I tried to connect two additional displays to get a triple display configuration consisting of the laptop display and two 22" monitors.

I first connected both monitors with DVI as those cables just about anywhere in the office but could not get it working. It seems that when you use both DVI ports that it blocks the display of the notebook itself. The solution was to use the DisplayPort connection with a real DisplayPort connection on the monitor. I also tried to a DisplayPort to DVI cable but that had the exact same result as just using DVI.

Now I have three displays active!
